# PromptMaster: AI Meta-Prompt (State File)
**Current Version:** 0.0.4 (Stable Launch Candidate)
**Core Architecture:** VS Code Extension API, BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) OS-Level Credential Vault (`context.secrets`), Dual-Blade Command Router.

## Current Capabilities
* **Command 1 (Copy Master Prompt):** Agnostic clipboard copy for use with external LLMs (Claude/ChatGPT).
* **Command 2 (Local Agent):** Native `@google/generative-ai` integration using Gemini 2.5 Flash for zero-friction IDE analysis.
* **The Engine:** Forces Big-O complexity analysis and Zero-Trust OWASP vulnerability audits on raw code.

## V5 Roadmap (The Cutting Edge)
1.  **The Threat Hunter Protocol:** Expand analysis beyond code. Add a dedicated command to analyze raw Splunk outputs, OSPF routing anomalies, subnet misconfigurations, and firewall logs.
2.  **Multi-Model Engine:** Integrate `@anthropic-ai/sdk` to route high-reasoning tasks to `claude-sonnet-4-6` and `claude-opus-4-6`.
3.  **Adaptive Settings UI:** Allow users to toggle default AI providers inside VS Code settings.
