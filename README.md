# 🚀 PromptMaster Pro

**Stop copy-pasting your code into ChatGPT. Get the perfect Master Prompt directly inside VS Code.**

PromptMaster Pro is a secure, BYOK AI prompt engineering extension for VS Code that generates context-aware architecture prompts for Claude, ChatGPT, and GitHub Copilot.

Highlight your messy code, right-click, and instantly generate a hyper-structured Master Prompt ready to be fed into any AI agent including GitHub Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT, or Cursor.

## ✨ Why You Need This

* **⚡ Zero Friction:** It lives right in your native VS Code right-click menu.
* **🧠 Instant Context:** Automatically grabs your highlighted code and file name so you don't have to explain your project to the AI.
* **🏗️ The "Meta-Agent" Brain:** It doesn't just copy your code; it wraps it in a strict System Prompt that forces the target AI to adopt a Senior Developer persona, break down the architecture, and adhere to strict coding constraints.
