# ⚔️ CipherForge: Autonomous Security

**State-of-the-Art Asymmetric Adversarial DevSecOps Engine.**

CipherForge is not a coding assistant. It is a localized, zero-trust cybersecurity orchestration layer that lives natively inside VS Code. It bridges the gap between static code generation and mathematically hardened enterprise security by forcing the world's most advanced LLMs into asymmetrical adversarial combat over your codebase.

## 🚀 The Paradigm Shift: Asymmetric Consensus
Current AI tools force developers to blindly trust a single model's output. CipherForge assumes all code is flawed until mathematically proven otherwise. 

When you trigger **Agentic Remediation**, CipherForge orchestrates a localized cyber-warfare simulation:
1. **The Defender (Claude 3.5 Sonnet @ 0.1 Temp):** The Blue Team model acts as a highly deterministic Principal Architect, rewriting your vulnerable code to enforce Big-O optimality and OWASP compliance.
2. **The Attacker (Gemini 3.1 Pro @ 0.7 Temp):** The Red Team model acts as a highly creative Threat Hunter, intercepting the newly written code and attempting to hack it, hunting for massive scaling bottlenecks or zero-day exploits.
3. **Consensus & Execution:** If the Red Team breaks the code, the Blue Team is forced to rebuild it. Once cryptographic consensus is reached, CipherForge calculates the text coordinates and surgically mutates your live file in real-time.

## 🛡️ Enterprise-Grade Features
* **OS-Level BYOK Vault:** CipherForge utilizes a "Bring Your Own Key" architecture, encrypting your API keys directly into your machine's native OS Keychain. Zero middleman servers. Zero telemetry.
* **Agentic Auto-Remediation:** Highlight a vulnerability, trigger the engine, and watch the code physically rewrite itself into a production-ready, fault-tolerant state.
* **Local RAG Context Engine:** CipherForge silently maps your workspace, automatically injecting your local dependencies into the neural network's context window.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory.
2. Install the VS Code packaging tool: `npm install -g @vscode/vsce`
3. Compile the extension: `vsce package`
4. In VS Code, open the Extensions panel, click the `...` menu, select **Install from VSIX**, and choose the generated `cipherforge-2.0.0.vsix` file.
